The long-term consumption frequency is estimated from a Markov model as its stationary distribution.

> </li>
> <ul><li><b>Between-user variability in consumption frequencies</b></li> Independent days consumption model assumes two levels of variability: (1) variability of consumption days (yes/no) per consumer, and (2) variability of (logit) frequencies between consumers. However, some consumption data sets may contain food types that are reported as consumed on all days, for all consumers. In that case, estimation of between consumer variability of the frequencies would not be possible. Even if there were a few occurrences which manifest such variation, they may be too few for reliable estimation. For example, if all respondents (except one) in the data consume a food type on all reporting days (100% frequency), and the one respondent does not consume it at all (0% frequency). Therefore, it is recommended to check the MCMC output for the variance parameter from the corresponding plots and to be aware of the quality of data used. ‘Between-user variability’ should be considered as part of the model only if there is enough data for estimating between consumer variance.

## [**Adjustment factors**]{style="color: #004F71"}

Changes in the adjustment factors modify the modelled contamination when calculating exposure. The default values are 1. A factor for **concentrations** should be any positive number. A factor for **prevalence** should be between zero (0) and one (1) to ensure that the multiplication produces a mathematically valid prevalence. The factors allow accounting for food processing effects which may either reduce the prevalence, and/or reduce or increase the concentration. Processing effects may be due to cooking, heating, freezing, washing, peeling, storage, etc.

$Figure$ $1.$ Variability distribution for positive hazard concentrations in food. The uncertainty of the true variability distribution is expressed by plotting a range (e.g. pointwise 95%CI) of probable variability distributions ([**straw color**]{style="color: #CEB888;"}). The uncertainty distribution for mean concentration ([**yellow color**]{style="color: #F7CE3C;"}) and median concentration ([**black color**]{style="color:#343841;"}) are plotted in bold lines. In log-scale, the mean and median are equal. For comparison with data, the raw data are represented as cumulative empirical distribution. For data containing censored concentration values, two empirical distributions are plotted, one with lower bound substitution ([**blueberry color**]{style="color: #004F71;"}) and one with upper bound substitution method ([**raspberry color**]{style="color: #D0006F;"}). These represent the best case and worst case interpretations for censored values. Also, data points are plotted as tick marks on the x-axis, showing exact measurements in [**raspberry color**]{style="color: #D0006F;"}, LOQ-values in [**green color**]{style="color: green;"}, and LOD-values in [**blueberry color**]{style="color: #004F71;"}. Note that the distributions in the figures represent truly positive concentrations, excluding zeros.

> **Graphical distributions of concentrations** show the variability distribution of positive hazard concentrations in foods. It is obvious that for some hazards (chemical or microbial) also true zero concentrations may be possible. Hence, the full model is a concentration-prevalence model. Because the hazard prevalence is not a fixed assumption, it is always estimated with some uncertainty bounds. The additional data specifications will determine how the data are interpreted and which model is accordingly used. If concentration data represent only truly “positives”, then estimation of prevalence requires separate prevalence data independently of concentration data, and the prevalence is estimated based on the sample size and the number of positives in the sample. In contrast, if concentration data represents “all” concentrations, including possible true zeros, then it leads to a zero-inflated model which estimates prevalence simultaneously with other parameters for concentration distribution. Separate prevalence data are not used or needed then. In both cases, the plot will always show distributions for positive concentrations and the estimated prevalence with 95%CI in a legend.

The uncertainty distributions for mean ([**yellow color**]{style="color: #F7CE3C;"}) and median ([**black color**]{style="color: #343841;"}) are plotted in bold lines. The (pseudo)empirical cumulative distribution simulated from bootstrapped data are shown using LB substitution ([**blueberry color**]{style="color: #004F71;"}) and UB substitution ([**raspberry color**]{style="color: #D0006F;"}) method. Note that the distributions in the figures represent truly positive exposures, excluding zeros.

>
> For <b>microbiological hazards</b>, the distribution of acute (individual single day) exposures is plotted, as population distribution of single amounts per day, over actually contaminated foods on actual consumption days. Hence, a single ‘serving’ here means one day consumption. For the microbiological exposures this in fact provides the distribution of expected values (which could be decimal numbers) of doses in the contaminated servings if consumed. The actual dose in a random serving would result as a random bacteria count from Poisson distribution that has such expected dose as the parameter.
>
> **A variability distribution** aims to describe how the positive exposure is distributed in the whole population of actual consumers. Therefore, the graphical image shows the worst case exposure that would result if all servings of the food were contaminated and the food was consumed daily. The legend box describes numerically how often the exposure happens.

> The total exposure will be computed as the summed exposure from the selected foods. Depending on hazard type, the exposure will be either *acute* (microbiological) or *chronic* (chemical). From the distribution of total exposure, a selected quantile point is estimated. The calculations employ 2D simulations (often computationally heavy). BIKE estimates **the quantile for two exposure distributions**: **(a)****^[**Positive exposure days only (worst case)** Positive acute exposure from a hazard-food combination occurs when both the hazard concentration and the food consumption are positive in a single serving day. Positive chronic exposure is likewise defined as the individual mean exposure from such positive exposures only. In other words: positive exposure does not include possible zero concentrations or zero consumption days. To evaluate total positive exposure from several foods, such positive exposures are summed over the selected foods. Note that this corresponds to a worst case scenario where all the selected foods are contaminated and they are all consumed on all days. The variation of such hypothetical total exposures is simulated to obtain a distribution for which the selected quantile point is estimated with 95% uncertainty bounds.]** the worst case exposure that results if all the (selected) foods are always contaminated and consumed daily, and **(b)****^[**Exposures for all days (including zeros)** Perhaps eventually of interest is the total exposure that accounts for both zero and positive daily exposures of the foods to be summed up. These occur according to the frequency of consumption days of each of the foods, and the prevalence of hazard contamination in each of the foods occurring on those consumption days. Typically, the proportion of zero exposure days can be large and some large exposure incidences may occur for some days only. This usually makes plotting of the total exposure distribution graphically infeasible. Therefore, the figure that appears in quantile plots shows a plot representing the variability distribution of total positive exposures only (as explained above). This may serve as a worst case risk assessment tool. However, the quantiles for the overall total exposure distribution, including random zero exposures are nevertheless evaluated and numerically given in the other legend in the same figure. The estimated 95% uncertainty interval of the required quantile may become nearly entirely zeros if the positive exposures are rare occasions leading mostly to zero exposures. For proving a low risk, this would be a good result!]** accounting the prevalence of contamination for each food as well as the actual consumption frequency of each food. The worst case total exposure distribution is shown graphically (and numerically in a legend), while the actual total exposure quantile is given only numerically in a legend.

### [**Posterior predictive distributions**]{style="color: #004F71"}

Posterior predictive distributions present predictions where all uncertainties and variabilities are integrated into one single probability distribution. This can be a useful summary for assessing what is now probable, given all the data with all its variability and uncertainties. The distribution is obtained by averaging (weighing) the possible variability distributions over the uncertainty distribution of their parameters.

### [**Exposure limit analysis**]{style="color: #004F71"}

Exposure limit analysis presents the part of the population (1 = 100%) with exposure below the limit given in the Occurrence dataset. The estimate is given for all days and for days with only positive consumption of contaminated food. The exposure limit can be set as a health based guidance value, for example tolerable daily intake TDI. Note that the exposure calculated by BIKE is in units per day (per bodyweight or as absolute), and thus a health based guidance value given in units per a longer time period  should be adjusted  to units per day before uploading data.

The columns Q05, Q50, Q95 refer to uncertainty quantiles for the 'Quantity' in first column. The 'Quantity' Q95(exposure) refer to the unknown quantiles of variability distribution. This becomes estimated with the indicated uncertainty quantiles Q05, Q50, Q95.
